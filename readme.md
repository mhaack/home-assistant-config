Here's our JaMa Villa Home Assistant configuration, running our home
automations. [Home Assistant][home-assistant] (HA) is an open-source home
automation platform which allows you to control devices easily, track multiple
sensors and integrate with a wide variety of commercial & DIY solutions.
I currently run it via [Hass.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/) on
a single Raspberry Pi. My HA configuration structure is heavily inspired by
the work done by [Franck Nijhof](https://github.com/frenck)

I try regularly update my configuration files, there is always something to
tweak or improve ðŸ˜‰. This repository is to inspire others, be free to use the
code from this repo for your own HA setup. If you think it is helpful and like
anything here, Be sure to ðŸŒŸ the GitHub repo.
